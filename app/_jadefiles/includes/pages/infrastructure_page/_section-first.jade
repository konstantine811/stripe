                            Architecting, developing and operating a genetic infrastructure is a difficult endeavor. Itâ€™s a resource heavy project that can take over 7-8 months.
                        p.txt-main-title.
                            There are multiple integration points with different services and data routing between these services controlled by a business logic which is in charge of handling sensitive genetic userdata. The block diagram below is an illustration of the architecture complexity behind a genetic product.
